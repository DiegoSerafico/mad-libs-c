<h1>Christmas MadLib Result</h1>
<p>I woke up in my @Model.NounOne on the morning of Christmas in</p>
<p>July at Windmill Point @Model.NounTwo. I heard a knock at the</p>
<p>door and @Model.VerbOne out of bed. When I opened the</p>
<p>@Model.NounThree to my trailer, there stood a @Model.AdjectiveOne</p>
<p>Santa and his @Model.NounFour waiting to give me my supplies for</p>
<p>my Christmas Craft! I @Model.VerbTwo for joy, taking</p>
<p>my Christmas Craft and running back into my trailer. I opened</p>
<p>the bag for my Christmas Craft, and I didn't get any</p>
<p>@Model.NounFive! I surely needed @Model.NounSix if I was going to</p>
<p>finish the craft! I ran out of my trailer to see if Santa was still</p>
<p>there, but he was nowhere to be found.</p>
